title: Rules
description: Things you should know when on our server!
---
We try not to push too many rules on our server but there are some things we have to enforce to make things easier on our users.
Keep in mind that we do this to protect ourselves and you on the server.
- Caps in global chat are not forbidden but don't overuse them.
- Depending on their mood, Admins are allowed to grow you, however do not ask for Grows/TP's as it might be seen as annoying and you will end up being ignored.
- If you fight against an Admin and die, your dino will be restored.
- Do NOT random nest invite.
- Insulting other players is forbidden.
- Cursing is not forbidden as long it's not directed as an insult to someone.
- Try to avoid map glitches and water surfing, no sport in that.
- Any form of mods/hacks/bug abuses are strictly forbidden and those who use them will receive a permanent ban without explanation.
- If you need help or want to report someone for any kind of abuse, use <span class="text-discord">#‚ùîticket-report</span> on Discord.
- If you want to suggest an idea use <span class="text-discord">#‚ùîsuggestions-chat</span> on Discord.
- If you participated in an arena event and feel the need to say something about it, positive or not (every form of critic is absolutely welcome) you can use 
<span class="text-discord">#üü©arena-reviews</span> on Discord.
- Arena rules can be found in <span class="text-discord">#üü•arena-rules</span> on Discord.
